# bird_species_classification

In this project, we aim to producing a model that gives the highest possible accuracy at classifying Bird species from the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. 
The data and the evaluation details are available on the Kaggle competition webpage:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/mva-recvis-2020/overview.
The file ```A3_MAYARD_hippolyte_report.pdf``` contains the pdf version of the final report that discusses the several techniques that have been used to obtain a public score of 0.81290 accuracy and a private accuracy of 0.85082.
The code is given in a ```.ipynb```format in the following notebook ```A3_MAYARD_hippolyte.ipynb```.
